I have the images and the data rendering from the API.
Next Step...
    Is there an API for all the skins or should i find them all and integrate them with mongoDB?
    I need to get the prices and ETC
    NEXT STEP: Get the skins via API or Database it.

MongoDB
  I have all the skins from mobafire, now i need to be able to integrate it into a DB and link them to each respective JSON object from express.

for each element in the array, print out the key and value(Aatrox skin model from men-lab)

Next Step:
  I have access to the skins in express. Now I need to place a conditional if the Champion name = SkinObject.name, print out all skinImg
