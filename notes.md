I have the images and the data rendering from the API.
Next Step...
    Is there an API for all the skins or should i find them all and integrate them with mongoDB?
    I need to get the prices and ETC
    NEXT STEP: Get the skins via API or Database it.

MongoDB
  I have all the skins from mobafire, now i need to be able to integrate it into a DB and link them to each respective JSON object from express.

for each element in the array, print out the key and value(Aatrox skin model from men-lab)

Next Step:
  I have access to the skins in express. Now I need to place a conditional if the Champion name = SkinObject.name, print out all skinImg. What if i push only the names from the API into an array, then do a forEach on those names and compare those to the results.name? maybe i can set each element in the name array to its own name?


I have each skin linked with each of the names in the name array.
Now I have to print them out next to each name in the view.
The problem now is that I can get the name of the name array to show, but the images from the API doesn't.
How do i loop through keys of objects in handlebars?
  loop through it in express with props and store both that and result props to an array and loop through that in handlebars?

dont put var to make it global?
