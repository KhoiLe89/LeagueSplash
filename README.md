# LeagueSplash
LeagueSplash was inspired by the popular MOBA video-game League of Legends. With no API for all the skins that each particular champion has, I envisioned this Web Application to be a place where users can view the attributes for each specific skin. Ultimately, I noticed there was a lack of sources that displayed such information, and sought to create an application that provided a solution for all League of Legends Fans.
## Installation
To install, clone down a copy from my personal GitHub account. Then To run this application locally, users must install express, express-handlebars, mongoose, and request. Run npm install --save {{dependency}}.
## User Stories
As a User, I can see the all the skins for all the champions
As a User, I can see the price of each skins
As a User, I can view the spotlight of each skin
As a User, I can see the upcoming major events RiotGames is hosting.

## Technologies Used
The Main Technologies used for this Web Application were MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. Most of the code was written on the server side via Node.js and Express.js. The database of each Champions "Skin Data" was done using MongoDB. Most of the front end was taken care of with AngularJS with the exception of the "Spotlight" page.

## Future Features
The app itself is fully functional but here are a few things I'd like to remedy and add:
  1. Users will be able to search through the database to display each skin based on, price, rarity, and availability.
  2. Users will be able to see a "What new with skins" banner that displays the newest skins and the skins that are currently on sale.
  3. Users will be able to bookmark a specific skin, and be notified when the skin comes on sale.
